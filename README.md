# N-queens

* I will develop a solver for the n-queens problem.

* wherein n queens are to be placed on an n x n chessboard so that no pair of queens can attack each other.

* Python 2, if you are using Python 3, there are few changes on imports.

* function n_queens_solutions(n) yields all valid placements of n queens on an n x n board.
